You will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico
+ Multiple LEDs in your choice of colour
+ Enough resistors for each LED
+ Enough socket-socket jumper wires for each LED

**Note:** The **positive** (long) leg of each LED should have a resistor attached. You should also attach jumper wires to both legs. 

The diagram below shows **three** single LEDs attached to a Raspberry Pi Pico.

+ Attach LED one to **GP13** and the closest **GND** pin
+ Attach LED two to **GP9** and the closest **GND** pin
+ Attach LED three to **GP5** and the closest **GND** pin
